# Phase 1 Step 1: Trips, Members, Invites, PIN - IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

## Completed Features

### ✅ Database Schema
- Defined TypeScript types for trips and trip_members tables
- Created comprehensive database types in `/src/types/database.ts`
- Included all required fields: PIN hashing, invite token versioning, RLS support

### ✅ Core Infrastructure
- Set up React Query for server state management with persistence
- Configured Supabase client for database operations
- Implemented Zod schemas for validation in `/src/schemas.ts`
- Set up Toast notifications with Sonner
- Created modular feature-based folder structure

### ✅ Trip Creation
- **Component**: `TripCreateForm` in `/src/features/trip/components/trip-create-form.tsx`
- **Hook**: `useCreateTrip` in `/src/features/trip/hooks/use-create-trip.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Trip name, destination, dates, currency, timezone
  - Optional PIN protection with bcrypt hashing
  - Duplicate policy selection (soft_block, prevent, allow)
  - Automatic organizer member creation
  - Form validation with React Hook Form + Zod
  - Optimistic updates and error handling

### ✅ Trip Joining
- **Component**: `TripJoinForm` in `/src/features/trip/components/trip-join-form.tsx`
- **Hook**: `useJoinTrip` in `/src/features/trip/hooks/use-join-trip.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Display name input for collaborators
  - PIN validation against hashed PIN in database
  - Client device ID generation for future offline support
  - Automatic collaborator member creation
  - Error handling for invalid PINs or missing trips

### ✅ User Interface
- **UI Components**: Created shadcn/ui compatible components
  - Button, Input, Label, Select, Textarea, Card
- **Pages**:
  - Home page with trip creation and join options
  - Join page with trip ID parameter support
  - Trip detail page showing trip info and members
- **Features**:
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
  - Invite link generation and clipboard copying
  - Trip member list display with roles
  - Loading states and error handling

### ✅ Authentication & Security
- PIN-based access control with bcrypt hashing
- Invite token versioning system (ready for rotation)
- Client mutation IDs for idempotency
- RLS-ready database schema (pending Supabase setup)

## Technical Patterns Established

### State Management
- React Query for server state with offline persistence
- Optimistic updates for mutations
- Proper error handling and toast notifications
- Query invalidation on successful mutations

### Form Handling
- React Hook Form with Zod resolvers
- Comprehensive validation schemas
- Accessible form controls with proper labeling
- Error message display

### Component Architecture
- Feature-based organization under `/src/features/`
- Colocated hooks, components, and logic
- Reusable UI primitives in `/src/components/ui/`
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout

## Next Steps (Phase 1 Step 2)

### Days & Blocks Implementation
1. **Database Operations**:
   - Create days automatically when trip is created
   - Generate 3 blocks per day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
   - Implement unique constraints on (trip_id, date)

2. **UI Components**:
   - Itinerary page component
   - Day cards with block sections
   - Block label renaming functionality

3. **Data Seeding**:
   - Auto-generate days based on trip start/end dates
   - Create blocks with default labels and positions

## Dependencies Met
- ✅ All required npm packages installed
- ✅ TypeScript configuration working
- ✅ Tailwind CSS configured
- ✅ React Query with persistence setup
- ✅ Supabase client configured (needs environment variables)

## Ready for Demo
The current implementation provides a working foundation for:
- Creating trips with PIN protection
- Joining trips via invite links
- Viewing trip details and member lists
- Basic responsive UI

**Note**: Requires Supabase environment variables to be configured for full functionality.

## Environment Setup Required
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```
