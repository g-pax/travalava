## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow Architecture
```typescript
// Activity Creation Flow
ActivityCreateForm → useCreateActivity → Supabase → Cache Invalidation → UI Update

// Proposal Assignment Flow
BlockSelector → useCreateProposal → Supabase → Multi-Cache Update → Block Display

// Block Display Flow
BlockCard → useBlockProposals → Activity Details → Responsive Display
```

### React Query Patterns
- **Optimistic Updates**: All mutations show immediate feedback
- **Cache Management**: Intelligent invalidation across related queries
- **Error Handling**: Automatic rollback with user notifications
- **Client Mutation IDs**: Ready for offline functionality

### State Management Strategy
- **Server State**: React Query handles all activity and proposal data
- **UI State**: Local component state for forms and modals
- **No State Duplication**: Single source of truth in React Query cache

### Form Validation & UX
- **Zod Schemas**: Comprehensive validation with custom error messages
- **React Hook Form**: Performance-optimized form handling
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, focus management, keyboard navigation
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during async operations

## Database Operations

### Activities Table
- **Full CRUD support** with proper type safety
- **JSON location storage** for geocoding data
- **Currency and cost handling** with decimal precision
- **Notes and links** with proper validation

### Block Proposals Table
- **Relationship management** between activities and blocks
- **Unique constraints** prevent duplicate proposals
- **Creator tracking** for audit purposes
- **Optimistic operations** with conflict resolution

## User Experience Features

### Activity Management
- **Intuitive Forms**: Step-by-step activity creation
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate updates and confirmations
- **Error Prevention**: Validation before submission
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-block assignment

### Block Assignment
- **Visual Selection**: Day/block grid interface
- **Status Indicators**: Committed blocks, existing proposals
- **Conflict Resolution**: Clear warnings and prevention
- **Batch Processing**: Assign to multiple blocks at once

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile First**: Works seamlessly on all screen sizes
- **Touch Friendly**: Appropriate button sizes and spacing
- **Adaptive Layouts**: Grid adjusts to available space
- **Accessible Controls**: Screen reader friendly

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Completed Functionality Tests
- [x] Activity creation with all field types
- [x] Activity list display and pagination
- [x] Activity deletion with dependency checks
- [x] Proposal creation and removal

## Next Steps (Phase 1 Step 4)

### Voting & Commit Implementation
1. **Voting System**:
   - Vote casting with time windows
   - Real-time vote counts
   - Multi-select voting interface

2. **Commit Logic**:
   - Automatic winner selection
   - Manual tie-breaking
   - Block locking after commit

3. **Vote Management**:
   - Vote history and audit
   - Voting window controls
   - Member participation tracking

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- **Query Batching**: Related data fetched together
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback
- **Cache Persistence**: Reduced network requests
- **Component Memoization**: Prevented unnecessary re-renders

### Scalability Notes
- Activities are paginated-ready (limit/offset structure)
- Proposals are indexed for efficient lookups
- All mutations include client IDs for offline support
- Cache keys designed for selective invalidation

## Ready for Demo

The Activities & Proposals system now provides:
- ✅ Complete activity lifecycle management
- ✅ Visual block assignment interface
- ✅ Real-time proposal display in itinerary
- ✅ Responsive, accessible UI throughout
- ✅ Robust error handling and validation
- ✅ Optimistic updates for smooth UX

**Note**: Ready to proceed to Phase 1 Step 4 (Voting & Commit Logic)

## Architecture Validation

### Feature Modularity
- ✅ Clean separation between activities and itinerary features
- ✅ Reusable hooks and components
- ✅ Consistent patterns across all modules

### Data Consistency
- ✅ Referential integrity maintained
- ✅ Cascade operations handled properly
- ✅ Optimistic updates with proper rollback

### User Experience
- ✅ Intuitive workflow from creation to assignment
- ✅ Clear visual feedback at every step
- ✅ Error prevention and recovery
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design

The implementation successfully bridges the gap between trip planning (activities) and scheduling (itinerary blocks), providing the foundation for the voting and commitment phases.
